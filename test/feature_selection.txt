🔍 Feature Selection with Linear & Logistic Regression
✅ 1. Both Models Provide Coefficients
Linear Regression: Coefficients show how much the predicted value changes with a 1-unit change in a feature.

Logistic Regression: Coefficients show how much the log-odds of a binary outcome change with a 1-unit increase in a feature.

📊 Why Use Coefficients for Feature Selection?
Coefficients help identify:

Which features most strongly affect the target

The direction of the effect (positive or negative)

The relative importance, when features are standardized

📐 Importance of Standardization
Before interpreting coefficients, standardize your features (mean = 0, std = 1):

Ensures comparability across features

Prevents misleading importance due to scale differences

python
Copy
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
🧪 Examples
➤ Linear Regression (continuous target)
python
Copy
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression().fit(X_scaled, y)
Feature	Coefficient	Interpretation
age	+0.5	1 SD increase in age → prediction ↑ 0.5
income	-0.3	1 SD increase in income → prediction ↓ 0.3

➤ Logistic Regression (binary target)
python
Copy
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression().fit(X_scaled, y)
Feature	Coefficient	Odds Ratio	Interpretation
days_since_login	+0.89	2.44	1 SD ↑ → odds of churn increase by 144%
logins_last_30_days	-0.38	0.69	1 SD ↑ → odds of churn decrease by 31%

📌 When to Use This Approach
✅ For interpretable models
✅ When you want to explain which features matter and why
✅ For quick feature selection in early modeling stages
