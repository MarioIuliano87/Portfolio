# Mario Iuliano Project Portfolio

## Introduction ## 

This is my first project portfolio and it aims to gather and store data analytics and data science projects, not only to showcase my skills but also to be exposed to the entire online community and exchange ideas, feedback and learn from other users.

I planned to publish 4 main projects: 

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Connect to an API and pull data  
- Linear Regression Modelling 
- Classification Modelling 

**The current status of my portfolio is work-in-progress**. I am currently working on the EDA topic which I'm planning to post in the next few weeks. 

## Who is Mario Iuliano? ## 

I was born in Salerno, a beatiful city in the south of Italy just attached to the Amalfi Coast. 

I studied foreign languages and moved to Dublin (Ireland) for my first job where I could apply my linguistic skills in an IT environment. 

This gave me exposure to data analytics (yes, I still remember the thrill I got after witnessing a data analyst running an SQL Statement :O ) 

Motivated and eager to learn how to query the data to disclose insights and allow my stakeholders to take important actions, I decided to start my evening Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at the Dublin Business School (DBS) which I concluded in Feb 21. 

I moved to Hamburg Germnay in June 2020 where I'm settling down with my future wife Sophie and our Brown Labrador Bonnie.

I'm obviously extremely interested and passionate about my job and I love reading about statistics, browsing other data science portfolio and learn every day something new. Hopefully this will lead me to my career goal of becoming a data scientist :)
